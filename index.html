            <ol>

              <li>Steven Spielberg's original concept for the movie was the story of a family that was terrorized in their home by aliens. He instead decided to go with a family-friendly movie and the family-in-jeopardy concept was developed into Poltergeist.</li>
              <li>Most of the script was written while filming Raiders of the Lost Ark. Spielberg dictated the story to screenwriter Melissa Mathison, who was the then-girlfriend and future wife of Harrison Ford.</li>
              <li>Drew Barrymore originally auditioned for the role of Carol Anne in Poltergeist, but Spielberg felt she was wrong for the role. It was that audition, however, that landed her the role of Gertie.</li>
              <li>Elliott was originally supposed to lure E.T. into the house with M&Ms, but Mars, Incorporated turned down the request to use their candy. Reese's Pieces were used instead, and the its placement resulted in a 65% surge in sales.</li>
              <li>E.T.'s face was modeled after the poet Carl Sandburg, a pug, and Albert Einstein.</li>
